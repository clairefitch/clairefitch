								<h2 class="major">We Called it Dirt</h2>
								
								<p>
								We never called it clay we called it dirt.
								A family anchors into the land.
								I can see it without having to read it.
								My life is not an open book it's electronic literature now.
								The inside is not the same as outside.
								I don't know if this is my story or your story.
								Events in my life were like pebble, stones and big rocks
								You'd only tell then that you'd know.
								The guy on the left and the guy on the right.
								It's gone back to the heather again, like the mountain.

		<p>Recordings from three walks around Drogheda and Laytown in May 2015 are folded into each other as a mass, there is no preference, with no foreground, middle ground or background.

			The texture is created from the natural rise and fall in amplitude and frequency.</p>

	<p>This work is an electroacoustic response to Victor Daniels talking about his experiences during World War II. Breaking a silence of almost 70 years he recalled his involvement in "Operation Gomorrah" when, as a 23yr old Sergeant in RAF 76 Squadron he participated in bombing raids on Essen and Hamburg. The work is a response to his memories of being shot down over enemy territory in July 1943 and his subsequent captivity as a prisoner of war in Stalag 4B.</p>
