								<h2 class="major">We Called it Dirt</h2>
								
								<p>
								We never called it clay, we called it dirt.
								A family anchors into the land.
								I can see it without having to read it.
								My life is not an open book, it's electronic literature now.
								The inside is not the same as outside.
								I don't know if this is my story or your story.
								Events in my life were like pebble, stones and big rocks
								You'd only tell then that you'd know.
								The guy on the left and the guy on the right.
								It's gone back to the heather again, like the mountain.

		<p>Shortlisted for the Hearsay Prize in 2014, Look (FFEBCD).
			It uses the hexadecimal javascript colour value of blanchedalmond as inspiration for the text that a crowdsourced group of people recorded as spoke, rapped, sung, or vocalized.  Using electroacoustic editing techniques, I produced many short audio clips which can be performed via the web browser.</p>

	<p>This work is an electroacoustic response to Victor Daniels talking about his experiences during World War II. Breaking a silence of almost 70 years he recalled his involvement in "Operation Gomorrah" when, as a 23yr old Sergeant in RAF 76 Squadron he participated in bombing raids on Essen and Hamburg. The work is a response to his memories of being shot down over enemy territory in July 1943 and his subsequent captivity as a prisoner of war in Stalag 4B.</p>
