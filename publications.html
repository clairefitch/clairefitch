							<p>Animated soundscore for Brass Band. Created from foley recordings of a Trombone mouthpiece, used to create an immersive backdrop to assist in the improvisation.
								Players are encouraged to move between what they see on the screen, what the hear emanating from a speaker and what they hear from their colleagues. The piece is created from the gaps, performers listening, adding, listening, adding, constantly unfolding and folding, creating a mass of sound, as if birds were starting to sing after silence.</p>

		<p>Shortlisted for the Hearsay Prize in 2014, Look (FFEBCD).
			It uses the hexadecimal javascript colour value of blanchedalmond as inspiration for the text that a crowdsourced group of people recorded as spoke, rapped, sung, or vocalized.  Using electroacoustic editing techniques, I produced many short audio clips which can be performed via the web browser.</p>

	<p>This work is an electroacoustic response to Victor Daniels talking about his experiences during World War II. Breaking a silence of almost 70 years he recalled his involvement in "Operation Gomorrah" when, as a 23yr old Sergeant in RAF 76 Squadron he participated in bombing raids on Essen and Hamburg. The work is a response to his memories of being shot down over enemy territory in July 1943 and his subsequent captivity as a prisoner of war in Stalag 4B.</p>
