Digital Content Site for Claire Fitch

I'm a composer, sound artist, and writer of electronic literature. My first job was in 1995, in the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra, playing cello. In 2002 I began producing audio content for games and film in Ireland, and in 2009 I started improvising with performance poets in Dublin. 2012 marked the year I left RTÉ and started teaching digital audio content skills to lots of students in various colleges around Ireland. Since 2015 I've been a lecturer at Dundalk Institute of Technology.
