							<p>Sound units and vocal utterances are neither atom or Cartesian points, but an elastic fold stretching the potential of the sound world. A multiplicity of sounds fold into the unity, which is in this instance inspired by Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention: “Return of the son of Monster Magnet” (1966),  Mauricio Kagel: “Anagramma” (1957/58) and Lewis Carroll: “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” (1865).</p>

								<p>Guessed the riddle yet?
								Haven’t the slightest idea.
								Better with the time.
								Time as well as I.
								Never even spoke to Time.
								Beat time when I learn.
								Twinkle, little bat!
								How I wonder what you’re at!
								Tea-tray in the sky.
								Murdering the time!
								
								Always six o’clock now
								It’s always tea-time
								I’ve had nothing yet.
								Easy take more than nothing
								Asked your opinion.
								Was a treacle well.
								Better finish the story.
								Course they were well in
								Very curious
								May as well go in at once.
								Age better this time.</p>
