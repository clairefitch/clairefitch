							<p>Sound units and vocal utterances are neither atom or Cartesian points, but an elastic fold stretching the potential of the sound world. A multiplicity of sounds fold into the unity, which is in this instance inspired by Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention: “Return of the son of Monster Magnet” (1966),  Mauricio Kagel: “Anagramma” (1957/58) and Lewis Carroll: “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” (1865).</p>

								<p>Vocal: Raven
									Text: Claire Fitch
									Inspiration: Chapter 7, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Lewis Carroll</p>

								<h2 class="major">Murdering The Time</h2>
								
								<p>Guessed the riddle yet?
								Haven’t the slightest idea.
								Better with the time.
								Time as well as I.
								Never even spoke to Time.
								Beat time when I learn.
								Twinkle, little bat!
								How I wonder what you’re at!
								Tea-tray in the sky.
								Murdering the time!
								
								Always six o’clock now
								It’s always tea-time
								I’ve had nothing yet.
								Easy take more than nothing
								Asked your opinion.
								Was a treacle well.
								Better finish the story.
								Course they were well in.
								Very curious.
								May as well go in at once.
								Age better this time.</p>

		<p>Recordings from three walks around Drogheda and Laytown in May 2015 are folded into each other as a mass, there is no preference, with no foreground, middle ground or background.

			The texture is created from the natural rise and fall in amplitude and frequency. The Gamescore can be accessed <a href="3DIM/3daysinmay.html">here</a>.</p>

	<p>This work is an electroacoustic response to Victor Daniels talking about his experiences during World War II. Breaking a silence of almost 70 years he recalled his involvement in "Operation Gomorrah" when, as a 23yr old Sergeant in RAF 76 Squadron he participated in bombing raids on Essen and Hamburg. The work is a response to his memories of being shot down over enemy territory in July 1943 and his subsequent captivity as a prisoner of war in Stalag 4B.</p>

	<p>Video example from the work Mrs McNa (2020), inspired from the two characters, Mrs McNamara and Mrs Matchwell who appear in chapters 29 and 30 of Sheridan Le Fanu’s The House by the Churchyard (1863). Bernard Clarke and Martina Murray recited the text which was exhibited as part of Scribbledehobble, curated by Bernard Clarke and Kaleidoscope at Museum of Literature of Ireland, 2020.

	<p>Video example from the work FFDEAD (2013), inspired by the hexadecimal code for the Javascript colour Navajowhite. I created a sonnet, which once recorded, became the basis for audio content for my first gamescore.
