### Hi there, I am Claire Fitch. 

This is where I'll share some of my sonic art, electronic literature and game score projects

I completed my PhD in 2019, supervised by Prof. Michael Alcorn at Queen's University Belfast.

Unfortunately I'm a lapsed cellist, previously working for the RTÃ‰ National Symphony Orchestra. 

My book, Sounding Emerging Media will be published by Routledge in April 2022.
